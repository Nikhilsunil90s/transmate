## billing module

Billing module is used for forwarders that manage shipments

- they can import the cost(s) from shipment costs
- they can add or remove fees
- the can see if it has been added to an invoice yes or no

## data structure

Billing items are a sum of:

- total Freight cost -> this is the sum to the billing currency of the customer of all freight costs
- additional items (invoiced or not)
- invoiced items with total

the difference is what is still to be billed.

when we have no invoice items:

- freight cost = sum...

when we have invoiced items:

- freight cost = sum - all invoiced freight items

The total freight cost is a dynamic field... after biling new items can be added.
When an invoice is generated, we need to record the items that were billed.

## visibility

- only visible for owner (== forwarder) -> the accountId should be the forwarder in this case.
