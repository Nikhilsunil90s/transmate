# Date Input with Timezone

The date time component has an additional toggle to switch between the location's timezone and the user's timezone.
Clicking on the timeZone would toggle between the location's timeZone and own timezone.
When no location timeZone is available, the timeZone is disabled and the the user timezone is shown.

## without only the user's timezone:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="timeZoneWithoutTimeZone">
    <Form>
      <DateTimeComboWithTZ />
    </Form>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## with a locationTimeZone

The toggle should be available and the user can switch between timeZones:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="timeZoneWithTimeZone">
    <Form>
      <DateTimeComboWithTZ
        locationTimeZone="Asia/Shanghai"
        onChange={console.log}
      />
    </Form>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

When entering / saving the data, we should keep track of both timezones, the one of the location and the one of the user.
When a user enters a timezone (without alteration of TZ), it will always be parsed in its own timezone.

When we toggle, we just need to keep track of what is entered (with respect to the selected TZ) and what is displayed.
In order to keep the entered dateTime correct we do the following:

1. set the current DateTimeValue to the entered TZ
2. update the value according to the Input
3. convert back to the user TZ
4. trigger Onchange / update state value

!! state Value is always the dateTime in the user timeZone!!

## with a locationTimeZone entry resulting in date difference

The toggle should be available and the user can switch between timeZones:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="timeZoneWithTimeZoneTriggersDateChange">
    <Form>
      <DateTimeComboWithTZ
        value={new Date("2021-09-09 22:30")}
        locationTimeZone="Asia/Shanghai"
        onChange={console.log}
      />
    </Form>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
